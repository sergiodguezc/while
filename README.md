# while
This repository contains an implementation of a simple imperative language
called "while" using Lean. The language has basic control structures such as
conditionals, loops, and assignments.

The implementation aims to capture the semantics of the language and provide a
framework for proving various properties about the language, such as 
termination, and correctness of various program transformations.

The implementation is grounded in the principles and techniques outlined in
several books, including "Semantics with Applications: An Appetizer" by Hanne
Riis Nielson and Flemming Nielson, as well as "The Formal Semantics of
Programming Languages: An Introduction" by Glynn Winskel.

## Language features
The "while" language has the following features:

- Integers as the only data type
- Variables and assignments
- Conditionals (if-then-else statements)
- Loops (while statements)
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
